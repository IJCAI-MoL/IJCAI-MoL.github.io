# Topic Description

Multi-output learning (MoL) aims to predict multiple outputs for an input, where the output values are characterized by diverse data types, such as binary, nominal, ordinal and real-valued variables. Such learning tasks arise in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from document classification, computer emulation, sensor network analysis, concept-based information retrieval, human action/causal induction, to video analysis, image annotation/retrieval, gene function prediction and brain science. Due to its popularity in applications, multi-output learning has also been widely explored in machine learning community, such as multi-label/multi-class classification, multi-target regression, hierarchical classification with class taxonomies, label sequence learning, sequence alignment learning, supervised grammar learning, and so on.

The theoretical properties of existing approaches for multi-output data are still not well understood. This triggers practitioners to develop novel methodologies and theories to deeply understand multi-output learning tasks. Moreover, the emerging trends of ultrahigh input and output dimensionality, and the complexly structured objects, lead to formidable challenges for multi-output learning. Therefore, it is imperative to propose practical mechanisms and efficient optimization algorithms for large-scale applications. Deep learning has gained much popularity in today’s research, and has been developed in recent years to deal with multi-label and multi-class classification problems. However, it remains non-trivial for practitioners to design novel deep neural networks that are appropriate for more comprehensive multi-output learning domains.

This workshop aims to publish state-of-the-art scientific works along this direction. We welcome all the original submissions with significant novel results, focusing on modelling, algorithm, theory, and real-world applications in the field of multi-output learning.
